### Permission System

## Testing

Tests are run with _Jest_ and _Enzyme_. Much of the testing consists of using `MockedProvider` from _React Apollo_ to supply fake data to various components. Components are then mounted in the test environment to ensure they render and function correctly. To JSON snapshots are kept and used to test the components, making sure that each new test matches the previous snapshot.

## Deployment

The site is deployed in three parts to _Heroku_. The database, the backend and the frontend each stand alone and work in concert. As changes are made in development and committed to _GitHub_ source control they first go through _Travis_, a continous integration service. The application is built and tested. As long as there are no errors and all tests pass the new code is deployed to _Heroku_ where it is updated. This system helps keep serious bugs from making their way into production.
